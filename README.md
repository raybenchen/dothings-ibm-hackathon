# dothings-ibm-hackathon
dothings is an event suggestion app based on your personality traits developed using node.js.
This app uses IBM Watson's Personality Insights service to extract personality traits from some text written by you, and uses that information to suggest events you would be interested in attending via meetup.com api. 

This app is currently live [here](http://dothings.mybluemix.net)
